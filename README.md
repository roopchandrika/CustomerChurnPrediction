# CustomerChurnPrediction

**Project Overview**
In this project, I implemented five machine learning algorithms—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes—on a telecom dataset to predict customer churn.

**Model Evaluation**: Analyzed and compared the performance of these models, ultimately selecting the most accurate one to identify customers at high risk of churning.
Insights Generation: Provided actionable insights for telecom companies, equipping them with data-driven strategies to address customer churn based on likelihood percentages.

**Skills Utilized**
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes
- Data Analysis and Model Comparison
- Insight Generation for Business Strategy
